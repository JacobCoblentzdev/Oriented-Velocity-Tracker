This is a project I worked on in my Engineering class. I used a complemtary filter as well as a kalmans filter to get accurate orientation data and from that data I convert euler angles to quaternion and rotate the z acceleration value by using quaternions

Now having a stable z acceleration value, it means I can get the following values Peak Acceleration, Max Velocity, and rep count.
